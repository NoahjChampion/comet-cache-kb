If your cache directory is empty, it could mean that Comet Cache isn't enabled, or that there is an error occurring behind the scenes that is preventing Comet Cache from operating normally, or that the cache directory was recently cleared by Comet Cache.

If Comet Cache is enabled (see **Dashboard → Comet Cache → Enable/Disable**) and running properly (see [How do I know if Comet Cache is working?](https://cometcache.com/kb-article/how-do-i-know-if-comet-cache-is-working/), then an empty cache directory could indicate that Comet Cache has not generated any cache files. Comet Cache will generate cache files when the plugin is active and a visitor visits your site while not logged in (unless you have Caching for Logged-In Users enabled, a Pro-only feature).

An empty cache directory could also mean that all of the cache files passed their expiration date (see **Dashboard → Comet Cache → Directory / Expiration Time**) or that Comet Cache recently cleared the entire cache automatically. 

There are a number of reasons why Comet Cache might clear the entire cache directory automatically: 

- You upgraded Comet Cache
- You restored the Comet Cache default settings
- You changed the WordPress theme
- You changed navigation menus
- You changed Links (you may or may not have the [Links SubPanel](https://codex.wordpress.org/Add_Link_SubPanel) on your site)
- You made changes to terms, e.g., Categories or Tags

Comet Cache automatically clears the cache when these events take place because not doing so would likely yield unexpected results. For example, if you modified your navigation menu and Comet Cache didn't clear the entire cache, visitors would be served cache files that included the old menu. Or if you changed your WordPress theme and didn't clear the cache, the old cache files would include the markup for the old theme. And so on.

If you find that none of the above scenarios are true and Comet Cache still has an empty cache directory, you should [verify that Comet Cache is working](https://cometcache.com/kb-article/how-do-i-know-if-comet-cache-is-working/).
