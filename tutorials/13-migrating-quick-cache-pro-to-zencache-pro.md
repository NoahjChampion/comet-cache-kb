## Step-by-Step: Migrating from Quick Cache Pro to Comet Cache Pro

See also: [Announcing Comet Cache™ (formerly Quick Cache)](http://cometcache.com/announcing-comet-cache-formerly-quick-cache/).

As an existing Quick Cache Pro customer, your Quick Cache Pro license entitles you to a free copy of Comet Cache Pro. There is no need to purchase Comet Cache Pro if you already own Quick Cache Pro. Please follow the steps below (or watch the video above) to use your existing customer account from WebSharks-Inc.com to login to cometcache.com, where you'll be able to access Comet Cache Pro and your free Comet Cache Pro license.

1. Collect your existing account details for Quick Cache Pro. You will need your username/password for [websharks-inc.com](http://www.websharks-inc.com/); i.e., the old site that was for Quick Cache Pro. If you lost those details, you can [recover them here](https://www.websharks-inc.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword).

2. Use those exact same login credentials to access an account that is _now waiting for you_ at cometcache.com; i.e., please [log into cometcache.com](https://cometcache.com/wp-login.php) with your existing websharks-inc.com username/password. _This works for existing Quick Cache Pro customers only._

3. Visit your [My Account page at cometcache.com](http://cometcache.com/account/), where you may now obtain a free copy of Comet Cache Pro. Please download the `comet-cache-pro.zip` file from this page.

4. Now upload and activate `comet-cache-pro.zip` (or it might be named something like: `comet-cache-pro-vXXXXXX.zip`). You can upload the ZIP file using your WordPress Dashboard; i.e. `Dashboard ⥱ Plugins ⥱ Add New ⥱ Upload Plugin`. _See attached screenshots for example._

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I already paid for Quick Cache Pro; do I need to buy Comet Cache Pro?

No. All Quick Cache Pro customers receive a free upgrade to Comet Cache Pro.

### How do I install Comet Cache if I already have Quick Cache installed?

Please Deactivate Quick Cache and/or Quick Cache Pro first (_don't_ delete the Quick Cache plugin until after you've installed Comet Cache; that way your existing Quick Cache options will be preserved in Comet Cache). Then, follow the instructions above to Install and Activate the new Comet Cache Pro plugin. That's it! :-)

### Can I delete Quick Cache Pro before installing Comet Cache Pro?

Yes. If you don't have any custom Quick Cache settings that you want Comet Cache Pro to import, then deleting Quick Cache before installing Comet Cache Pro will be fine.

### Will my old Quick Cache settings carry over to Comet Cache?

Yes. If you had Quick Cache Pro installed prior to installing Comet Cache Pro, all of your Quick Cache Pro configuration options will be picked-up by Comet Cache Pro automatically.

### If I had plugins/themes that were customized to integrate with Quick Cache, will those customizations still work with Comet Cache?

Most likely, yes. We have built Comet Cache to be backwards-compatible with Quick Cache so if you were using `$GLOBALS['quick_cache']` or using the `QUICK_CACHE_ALLOWED` constant, these will still work with Comet Cache.

### What if I don't remember my account details for Quick Cache Pro?

See **Step 1** above. You will need your username/password for [websharks-inc.com](http://www.websharks-inc.com/); i.e., the old site that was for Quick Cache Pro. If you lost those details, you can [recover them here](https://www.websharks-inc.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword). You should [log into the new site at cometcache.com](https://cometcache.com/wp-login.php) using the same credentials that you use at websharks-inc.com.

### How many years of Support & Upgrades will I receive if I'm already a Quick Cache Pro customer?

All Quick Cache Pro customers receive a free upgrade to Comet Cache Pro. This upgrade also includes 3 years of free support/upgrades for Comet Cache Pro.

### Will my account at websharks-inc.com be sychronized with my account at cometcache.com?

Not exactly. Existing Quick Cache Pro customers are able to log into cometcache.com and receive a free upgrade; see instructions above. However, once you log into cometcache.com for the first time, the two accounts diverge. You will then have two separate accounts. One for the old site at websharks-inc.com, and another for the new site at cometcache.com! :-)

### If I configure Comet Cache Pro to perform automatic updates, what license key should I enter? The one for Quick Cache Pro, or the one for Comet Cache Pro?

Please use a new license key for Comet Cache Pro. You will find your new license key for Comet Cache Pro at cometcache.com. Please check your [My Account](http://cometcache.com/account/) page.
