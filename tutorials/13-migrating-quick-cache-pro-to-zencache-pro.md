## Step-by-Step: Migrating from Quick Cache Pro to ZenCache Pro

See also: [Announcing ZenCache™ (formerly Quick Cache)](http://zencache.com/announcing-zencache-formerly-quick-cache/).

As an existing Quick Cache Pro customer, your Quick Cache Pro license entitles you to a free copy of ZenCache Pro. There is no need to purchase ZenCache Pro if you already own Quick Cache Pro. Please follow the steps below (or watch the video above) to use your existing customer account from WebSharks-Inc.com to login to ZenCache.com, where you'll be able to access ZenCache Pro and your free ZenCache Pro license.

1. Collect your existing account details for Quick Cache Pro. You will need your username/password for [websharks-inc.com](http://www.websharks-inc.com/); i.e., the old site that was for Quick Cache Pro. If you lost those details, you can [recover them here](https://www.websharks-inc.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword).

2. Use those exact same login credentials to access an account that is _now waiting for you_ at ZenCache.com; i.e., please [log into ZenCache.com](https://zencache.com/wp-login.php) with your existing websharks-inc.com username/password. _This works for existing Quick Cache Pro customers only._

3. Visit your [My Account page at ZenCache.com](http://zencache.com/account/), where you may now obtain a free copy of ZenCache Pro. Please download the `zencache-pro.zip` file from this page.

4. Now upload and activate `zencache-pro.zip` (or it might be named something like: `zencache-pro-vXXXXXX.zip`). You can upload the ZIP file using your WordPress Dashboard; i.e. `Dashboard ⥱ Plugins ⥱ Add New ⥱ Upload Plugin`. _See attached screenshots for example._

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I already paid for Quick Cache Pro; do I need to buy ZenCache Pro?

No. All Quick Cache Pro customers receive a free upgrade to ZenCache Pro.

### How do I install ZenCache if I already have Quick Cache installed?

Please Deactivate Quick Cache and/or Quick Cache Pro first (_don't_ delete the Quick Cache plugin until after you've installed ZenCache; that way your existing Quick Cache options will be preserved in ZenCache). Then, follow the instructions above to Install and Activate the new ZenCache Pro plugin. That's it! :-)

### Can I delete Quick Cache Pro before installing ZenCache Pro?

Yes. If you don't have any custom Quick Cache settings that you want ZenCache Pro to import, then deleting Quick Cache before installing ZenCache Pro will be fine.

### Will my old Quick Cache settings carry over to ZenCache?

Yes. If you had Quick Cache Pro installed prior to installing ZenCache Pro, all of your Quick Cache Pro configuration options will be picked-up by ZenCache Pro automatically.

### If I had plugins/themes that were customized to integrate with Quick Cache, will those customizations still work with ZenCache?

Most likely, yes. We have build ZenCache to be backwards-compatible with Quick Cache so if you were using the Quick Cache API (`$GLOBALS['quick_cache']`), or using the `QUICK_CACHE_ALLOWED` constant, these will still work with ZenCache. 

### What if I don't remember my account details for Quick Cache Pro?

See **Step 1** above. You will need your username/password for [websharks-inc.com](http://www.websharks-inc.com/); i.e., the old site that was for Quick Cache Pro. If you lost those details, you can [recover them here](https://www.websharks-inc.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword). You should [log into the new site at ZenCache.com](https://zencache.com/wp-login.php) using the same credentials that you use at websharks-inc.com.

### How many years of Support & Upgrades will I receive if I'm already a Quick Cache Pro customer?

All Quick Cache Pro customers receive a free upgrade to ZenCache Pro. This upgrade also includes 3 years of free support/upgrades for ZenCache Pro.

### Will my account at websharks-inc.com be sychronized with my account at ZenCache.com?

Not exactly. Existing Quick Cache Pro customers are able to log into ZenCache.com and receive a free upgrade; see instructions above. However, once you log into ZenCache.com for the first time, the two accounts diverge. You will then have two separate accounts. One for the old site at websharks-inc.com, and another for the new site at ZenCache.com! :-)

### If I configure ZenCache Pro to perform automatic updates, what license key should I enter? The one for Quick Cache Pro, or the one for ZenCache Pro?

Please use a new license key for ZenCache Pro. You will find your new license key for ZenCache Pro at ZenCache.com. Please check your [My Account](http://zencache.com/account/) page.
